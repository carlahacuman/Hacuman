				<p> When I steps in high school i feel like that I'm back to te old me,I was sepereted to my best friend because she go to manila and i felt to lonely and hurt at the same time. But times come i already adapt in that environemt,I have that cirile of friend that I'm very close to. My journey in high school is very nice and very memorable moments,not until I step on grade 9.That really change the whole me,so much pain to handle. Having a surgery at the young age is really painful,also it's really hard physically and mentally to cop up that pain. I already lost that hopeto fight again but thanks God I overcome that surgery. </p>
