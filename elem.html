				<p>When i was elementary i don't care about what they say. I use to be shy and unactive girl, alone and "dugyot" haha. A that has a guinine smile back then a sincere smile, even a little things can make me happy. A girl that doesn't think about the surroundings, girl that only wants a happiness and care from she's family.Back when I was in elementary I use to be a shy girl,silent girl because they use to bully me. I don't even know the reason why but maybe beacuse my appearance, I have a lot of insecurities when I'm elementary.They They even calledmy parents beacuse I'm silent in school, I always hide my face and don't talk to others. But it all change when I met my best friend, she really help me to boost my confidenenceand walk behind my limit. Were so close that others even think that we are siblings.</p>
